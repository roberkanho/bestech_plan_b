Audience
--------

The intended audience for MindMeld Workbench (and for this guide) are data scientists and machine learning engineers with proficiency in Python. For those new to these computer science disciplines, Coursera's Stanford courses on `Machine Learning <https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning>`_ and `Natural Language Processing <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfoudtpBV68>`_ are excellent starting points.
