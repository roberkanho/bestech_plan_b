mindmeld.components.role_classifier module
******************************************

This module contains the role classifier component of the MindMeld
natural language processor.

class mindmeld.components.role_classifier.RoleClassifier(resource_loader, domain, intent, entity_type)

   Bases: "mindmeld.components.classifier.Classifier"

   A role classifier is used to determine the target role for entities
   in a given query. It is trained using all the labeled queries for a
   particular intent. The labels are the role names associated with
   each entity within each query.

   domain

      *str* – The domain that this role classifier belongs to

   intent

      *str* – The intent that this role classifier belongs to

   entity_type

      *str* – The entity type that this role classifier is for

   roles

      *set* – A set containing the roles which can be classified

   dump(model_path, incremental_model_path=None)

      Persists the trained role classification model to disk.

      Parameters:
         * **model_path** (*str*) – The model path.

         * **incremental_model_path** (*str**, **Optional*) – The
           timestamped folder where the cached                 models
           are stored.

   fit(queries=None, label_set=None, incremental_timestamp=None, **kwargs)

      Trains a statistical model for role classification using the
      provided training examples.

      Parameters:
         * **queries** (*list of ProcessedQuery*) – The labeled
           queries to use as training data

         * **label_set** (*list**, **optional*) – A label set to
           load. If not specified, the default training set will be
           loaded.

         * **incremental_timestamp** (*str**, **optional*) – The
           timestamp folder to cache models in

   inspect(query, gold_label=None, dynamic_resource=None)

   load(model_path)

      Loads the trained role classification model from disk.

      Parameters:
         **model_path** (*str*) – The location on disk where the model
         is stored

   predict(query, entities, entity_index)

      Predicts a role for the given entity using the trained role
      classification model.

      Parameters:
         * **query** (*Query*) – The input query

         * **entities** (*list*) – The entities in the query

         * **entity_index** (*int*) – The index of the entity whose
           role should be classified

      Returns:
         The predicted role for the provided entity

      Return type:
         str

   predict_proba(query, entities, entity_index)

      Runs prediction on a given entity and generates multiple role
      hypotheses and associated probabilities using the trained role
      classification model.

      Parameters:
         * **query** (*Query*) – The input query

         * **entities** (*list*) – The entities in the query

         * **entity_index** (*int*) – The index of the entity whose
           role should be classified

      Returns:
         a list of tuples of the form (str, float) grouping roles and
         their probabilities

      Return type:
         list

   view_extracted_features(query, entities, entity_index)

      Extracts features for a given entity for role classification.

      Parameters:
         * **query** (*Query** or **str*) – The input query

         * **entities** (*list*) – The entities in the query

         * **entity_index** (*int*) – The index of the entity whose
           role should be classified

      Returns:
         The extracted features from the given input

      Return type:
         dict

   CLF_TYPE = 'role'
